# Electing Women

> UI for the electing women toolkit for Women's Peer 2 Peer network developed using vue.js

when its finished, this will be a web application that 1) enables women politicians running for office in developing countries to share the threats, violence, and intimidation they face on the campaign trail even if they don't have access to the internet (we are using the Twilio API for the backend) 2) connect with a community of other women politicians since research has shown women are less likely to drop out of politics if they have a strong support system 3) there will be a feature to get help for emergencies 4) safety will be prioritized in this app so we will have a strong focus on privacy 5) the app (currently) has a "testimony" page full of candidates stories. these are all hard-coded for now but will be linked to a database in the future!

# This project uses vue.js & bootstrap. If you are new to either one of those two frameworks, here are some good guides to follow:
